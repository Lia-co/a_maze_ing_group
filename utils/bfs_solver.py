"""
Breadth-first Search (BFS) Solution

The algorithm starts at the entry point, and it push all surrounding
accessible neighbors in a queue waiting for visiting. The visited current
cell will be the parent cell for its neighbors.

Important variables for this algorithm:
- current cell: mark the current cell
- queue: the waiting line of cells will be visited
- visited: record all visited cell. If the cell is within the visited cell
- list, it won't be add to the queue again
- parent: record the cell's parent cell, and it will become the path
